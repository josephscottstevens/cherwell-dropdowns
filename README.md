# Cherwell UX Enhancer

Cherwell is a widely-used tool for ticket management. However, like any software, there are areas where the user experience could be improved. This open-source project aims to enhance the usability of the Cherwell application, starting with an improvement to the team selection process.

## Key Features

- **Improved Team Selection Interface**:  
  Adds a dropdown to the team selection UI, allowing users to quickly and directly select their team without navigating the cumbersome team search interface. This feature saves time and streamlines the workflow.

## Open Source

This project is open source, inviting contributions and feedback from the community to make Cherwell an even better tool.
